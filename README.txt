== DESCRIPTION:

An actor library for dynamic languages like Ruby and Python.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

dramatis provides a library for writing concurrent programs using the actor programming model.

This is an early version, the first release with packaging (a gem for ruby, distutils for python).

It's available on github to download and does come with documentation, a tutorial, and several examples, all of which (mostly) work, so it's stable enough to being to play with.
