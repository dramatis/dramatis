== DESCRIPTION:

An actor library for dynamic languages.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

THIS IS A VERY EARLY VERSION. It's effectively unreleased; I'm sticking
it on github without announcement to share with a few people that do
know about it.

Of course, it's on github, so if you REALLY want to go for it, go for it.

I expect a "real" release mid-April. It will still be alpha, but the
goal between now and then is to add a couple more features, and
significantly beef up the docs, tutorials, and demos.

repository: git@github.com:dramatis/dramatis.git

Mailing list: dramatis@googlegroups.com /
              http://groups.google.com/group/dramatis

IRC: #dramatis @ freenode

Website/Wiki/tracker to come between now and release.

That said, I guess I can say:

It runs on Ruby 1.8.6, 1.9, and JRuby 1.1 on Linux
A lot runs on OS X

It's supposed to run on Python 2.5 some day ...
